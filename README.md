# CS430Project5

Procedure:
I really liked this project. We had a lot of resources available to us and we simply had to utilize them as frameworks and puzzle the pieces together.
I simple just had to add an extra function to our linmath.h head file: specific for shearing.

Controls:

Arrow Keys:

Up: Scale up
Down: Scale down
Left: Rotate left
Right: Rotate right

Letter Keys:

A: Translate left
D: Translate right
Q: Shear negative
E: Shear positive
